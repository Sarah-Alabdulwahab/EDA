# Exploratory Data Analysis of The Metropolitan Transportation Authority Turnstile Data

The goal of this project is to find the stations that need new turnstiles in order to reduce traffic and ease the transportation experience for every individual.


In order to accomplish this goal, I used a bar plot to visualize the traffic in each station, hence the number of entries and exits at a certain instance, to find the busiest station.

The figure above shows that ... station is the busiest. Therefore, it is possibly the best place to add the new turnstile and in return reduce the traffic in that station.
